During my final year of Bachelor’s in Engineering, I published a research paper in the International Journal of Research and Review (IJRR) on the implementation of the Apriori Algorithm using the MapReduce framework. The research focused on optimizing frequent itemset mining for large-scale transactional datasets by distributing computation across a cluster environment. The paper highlighted scalability, parallel processing advantages, and practical applications in market basket analysis and big data analytics. This work strengthened my understanding of distributed computing, data mining algorithms, and large-scale data processing concepts.
